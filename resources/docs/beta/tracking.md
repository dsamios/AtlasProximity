## How it works

Using the [Valve Source Query protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries) we're able to pull player information from the official (and unofficial) Atlas servers. The only information we can access is the `steam username` and the `time spent` on this particular server.

## How to avoid being tracked

The information we pull is completely public, we use no hacky ways to pull information that nobody else would be able to pull.

If you want to avoid getting tracked by this bot or any bot / map out there you can change your Steam name to `123`. This will not remove you completely but because so many people use the name `123` it's practically impossible to get a good tracking done on that name (because it keeps appearing on several servers at once).
